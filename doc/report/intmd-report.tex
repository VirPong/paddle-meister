\subsection{Git and Github}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Git (http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely-used in the open source community.
		\item Github (http://github.com/) is a web-based hosting service for projects using git. It provides collaboration tools and many other features such as pull requests and commit management that helps small development groups work efficiently.
		\item The current project repository is hosted on github and collaboration will happen through the web-based UI.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{node.js}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item node.js (http://nodejs.org/) is an easy-to-learn server-side JavaScript server development environment that supports a myriad of different communication protocols such as HTTP, TCP, and WebSockets.
		\item Will be used as the framework for the server.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{MongoDB}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item MongoDB (http://mongodb.org/) is a scalable open-source non-relational database with strong node.js support.
		\item Will be used as the main database for storing and retrieving game information.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Eclipse}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment written in Java that provides support for many different programming languages and version control systems through plugins -- A git plugin is available, called Egit (http://eclipse.org/egit/).
		\item Most team members will be using Eclipse IDE for development.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Google Docs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Google Docs (http://docs.google.com/) is an online document processor with tools similar to Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and others. It allows for collaboration between different users concurrently on the same document.
		\item Will be used for collaboration on internal documents and documentation.
	\end{itemize}
\section{Schedule}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Oct 7 -- A database implemented on the server.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Be able to have the server do a simple query from the mongoDB database and display it.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Oct 7 -- Get the server up and running. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Be able to have a server that provides text or visual response to simple sample packets from other computers and relays sample information from the database.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Oct 11 -- Basic server communication to other devices. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Have a proof of concept for devices on the Android and iOS platforms to be able to communicate with the server. 
		\item Have the clients be able to display information queried from the mongoDB database by communicating with the server.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Oct 17 -- Simple game engine/logic working.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Translate the rules of two-player (non-computer opponents) pong into JavaScript code that the server can use.
		\item Most likely will test on a browser such as Chrome or Chromium first.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Nov 4 -- Real-time game streaming on web browsers.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Be able to watch a game that is happening between two other clients on a third client (most likely a browser at first
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
